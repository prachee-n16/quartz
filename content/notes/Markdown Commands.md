title: "Markdown Commands"

*A personal cheatsheet to various Markdown commands and keybindings to be used within Obsidian!*

Markdown does not support underline - mostly, because it's used for links and it's hard to read anyways. Alternate option, use html tags to underline text: <ins>hello world</ins>
