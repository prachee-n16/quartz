{"/":{"title":"Prachee Nanda","content":"Hi there üëã! Welcome to my digital garden, a collection of notes on topics that have captured my interest and curiosity. Inspired by the Zettelkasten approach, my aim is to expand my knowledge and discover new insights.\n\nThis notebook will keep on changing and improving over time, so don't expect it to be perfect yet. Some pages might still be a work in progress.\n- [[notes/Projects|Projects]]\n- [[notes/Areas/Areas|Areas]]\n- [[notes/Resources|Resources]]\n- [[notes/Archives|Archives]]\n\nWhile I'm still playing around with how I want to build my `second brain`, here are some basic principles I follow!\n\nMy process for generating content for the second brain is based on the CODE system. This involves 4 steps: **C**apture, **O**rganize, **D**istill and **E**xpress. In brief,\n\n- Capture: The idea is to capture information that is interesting, relevant or personal to me.\n- Organize: I plan to write on a variety of topics, so organizing all these notes is key! The basic rule of thumb is PARA, which stands for **PROJECTS**, **AREAS**, **RESOURCES**, **ARCHIVE**. I'm also looking into tagging all notes as an alternative form of finding content in the future.\n- Distill: Condensing information into the key points. This would be more critical when I am taking course notes or self-learning a topic.\n- Express: With Obsidian, I want to use the Graph view to make connections across the various notes.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Archives":{"title":"üóÑÔ∏è Archives","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Areas/Areas":{"title":"üî≠ Areas","content":"This space is designed to link to all major notes within the area. \n- [[Areas/ZETTELKASTEN ~ A better way to write notes! |ZETTELKASTEN]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Areas/Collectors-Fallacy":{"title":"Collector's Fallacy","content":"To know about something is not the same as knowing something.\n\nThe idea here is that we like collecting information, hoping that it will be useful down the way. However, this mindless collection of ideas is creating a fake sense of knowledge. We know the information but we don't actually break it down into our own ideas and words. \n\nAm I guilty of this? Possibly~ I noted that my review sheets during exams was helpful because I was taking the content and writing them down as possible questions. In a way, I'm breaking this down into how I actually was understanding the content. There is some deliberation in this method!\n\nA good way to get out of this is: knowledge cycle!\n- Read any text for an hour, and when the time limit is over, look back and see what you have learnt!\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":["NoteTaking","ZettelkastenGuide"]},"/notes/Areas/ZETTELKASTEN-~-A-better-way-to-write-notes":{"title":"Zettelkasten","content":"Note: I'm referencing [zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method) to understand how to incorporate this into my daily note-taking!\n\nContrary to what a \"[[Zettel]]\" should be, i.e. adhere to principle of atomicity and be \"hyper-textual\", I am not placing any such constraints here. While I will try to achieve this, my main goal is to familiarize myself with how it works. \n\nIn this system, it is recommended that there are no categories as explained in this article: [#Why Categories for Your Note Archive are a Bad Idea](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/)\n\nHowever, this isn't the most suitable for my style. I need a way to differentiate my personal items from work or school. So, let's keep them really general! For now, internally, the four major categories are:\n- **PERSONAL**: Related to health, finance, personal logs etc\n- **WORK**: Related to internships, resumes, etc\n- **STUDY**: Related to true knowledge items, things I'm learning currently\nI will try my best to avoid subcategories, but I can see situations where it's better to have order over an organic structure.\n\n\u003e [!tip] When starting out, ask yourself:\n\u003e  **Is your Zettelkasten designed for a single writing project or topic, or do you want to map all you know with this tool?**\n\nI want to map everything I know! I want to create a place where I can write about everything I'm learning and connect it to other concepts I've learned. This ecosystem will benefit from overview notes as gentle intros to a topic, similar to this note.ZettelkastenTools\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":["NoteTaking","ZettelkastenGuide"]},"/notes/Areas/Zettel":{"title":"Zettel","content":"Essentially, a single note on one particular topic! The anatomy of a zettel looks like:\n- Unique Identifier: an unambiguous address\n\t- This is mandatory! Why? Cause it allows for a unique way to identify each note. There are some ways we can go about achieving this!\n\t- Luhmann-ID\n\t\t- It's a hierarchy and sort of similar to how indexing with bullet points work. You have Note 1 and Note 2, and a note between this would be called Note 1a\n\t- Time-based ID + Arbit. unique string\n\t\t- This is what i'm going to use since Obsidian has support for this. Note, each [[Zettel]] will end up having it's own unique string i.e. \"title\" anyways.\n- Body/Content: the actual content\n- Footer/References: source of knowledge or personal thoughts\n\t- Also, consider [[Collector's Fallacy]]\nWhen adding links to other content, there needs to be an explanation as to why it is there! If not, this is not knowledge but information!\n- This was an interesting point mentioned somewhere in: https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#luhmann-s-zettelkasten. How do we categorize text as \"knowledge\" or \"information\"? Even better, how do I know what I am writing is knowledge (very critical for zettelkasten)!\n\t- Well, information is \"dead\" - it needs processing for it to give any relevant information. If I write out all the calories I consumed in a day, that's just information on by daily eating habits. Knowledge would be to dissect this and make some inferences. \n\nThere are a few things to consider in terms of actual contents: Writing the note, expanding the note, and when has it become too inflated. \n- Keep a draft outline which involves bulletting ideas \n- When expanding a note: add items to a collection, add references to back up a point or write a text to incorporate new knowledge. \n- There's no universal guideline to know when it's too big, but re-reading notes and considering if it can be broken down further.\n\nA great read: [Object Tags vs. Topic Tags](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/)","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":["NoteTaking","ZettelkastenGuide"]},"/notes/Projects":{"title":"‚úÖ Projects","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Resources":{"title":"üìö Resources","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T21:43:08.484894769Z","tags":[]}}
