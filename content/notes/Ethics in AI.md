**Filter Bubbles**
The goal of content recommendation systems, especially those used in social media/newsfeeds, is to provide personalized searches. The unintended effect can be an *intellectual isolation* - you keep being offered curated results, but you find yourself in a bubble of only your own ideas.
- How is this different from an epistemic bubble? In this situation, the user never gets the information by fault of the algorithm. Epistemic bubble is that the opposing view is simply left out.

**Echo Chambers**
Stemming from filter bubbles, we see echo chambers: Users come across content that only amplifies & reinforces their beliefs. Essentially, it's confirmation bias.
