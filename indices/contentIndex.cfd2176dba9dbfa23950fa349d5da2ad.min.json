In brief, \n- Capture: The idea is to capture information that is interesting, relevant or personal to me. \n- Organize: I plan to write on a variety of topics, so organizing all these notes is key! The basic rule of thumb is PARA, which stands for **PROJECTS**, **AREAS**, **RESOURCES**, **ARCHIVE**. I'm also looking into tagging all notes as an alternative form of finding content in the future.\n- Distill: Condensing information into the key points.

The two are connected such that the motor turns on when the sensor detects light, and turns off when the sensor detects no light. So, this gives the effect that the vehicle seeks out light sources.\n\nHence, the sensor-motor wiring gives rise to interesting effects. Note, this seems intelligent (to be moving towards light source) but is completely decentralized.\n\n**Agents**\n- System that processes data, produces an output from input\n- Reflex agent - reacts to input, Memory agent - reacts to maybe past decisions","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T15:29:10.242210404Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Ethics-in-AI":{"title":"Ethics in AI","content":"**Filter Bubbles**\nThe goal of content recommendation systems, especially those used in social media/newsfeeds, is to provide personalized searches.

There might be a gap between **truth** and **proof**.\n\nFirst, mathematics might not be consistent (i.e. existence of paradoxes). We set down axioms - statements that are self-evidently true for all cases in our mathematical system.\n- Before G√∂del, the initial idea was: We can prove any statement in mathematics if we have a strong enough set of axioms.\n\nG√∂del Coding - Any mathematical statement could be turned into a unique number. A little bit of a simplification but imagine that if a statement can be derived from an axiom, both the numbers will be divisible by each other.\n\nG√∂del's Challenge - Assume a statement cannot be proved from the set of axioms. This statement can be turned into a mathematical equation.\n- Assume that statement is false. This means the statement can be proved from the set of axioms.\n- Contradiction! We assumed this statement can not be proved, but now we have deduced it can be. Since we assume mathematics is consistent, this has to be false.\n\nSo, for any consistent mathematical system, there must be a statement that cannot be proved from the set of axioms.\n\nThe \"regressive\" solution is to add this as an axiom, but that's not really a good solution. I can still find out a statement that's not provable by the axioms.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T15:29:10.242210404Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Generating-Job-Resources-based-on-LinkedIn-Job-Descriptions":{"title":"Generating Job Resources based on LinkedIn Job Descriptions","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T15:29:10.242210404Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Gesture-Recognition-with-AI-to-improve-Human-Computer-Interactions":{"title":"Gesture Recognition with AI to improve Human-Computer Interactions","content":"**Overall Idea**\nDesktop application that can detect hand gestures/ facial expressions and use them as keybinds, allowing them to function as shortcuts or commands. \n\n**Implementation Details**\nPart 1: Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow \u0026 OpenCV\n\nFrom [Developer's Google Guide on MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/gesture_recognizer),\nWith MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer,\n- Recognize hand gestures in real time\n- Provide landmarks of the detected hands (21 key points that it tracks)\n- Handedness - which hand is being used to make gesture?

When X wins, let's say the \"value\" of that board is 1 and when O wins the \"value\" is -1. If it's a draw, we assign a 0 to the board value. At any point in the game, X wants to maximize and O wants to minimize.\n\n![[notes/images/minimax_algorithm.png]]\n\n*Source: Elements of AI*\n\nIf we start from board 1, let's chart out all possible states the game will end up in. We keep branching out until we come across an end game situation.\n\nWorking bottom-up, board 5 and 6 can be said to have a value -1 because it leads to a win for O. Board 2 then must also lead to an eventual win for O, so it has a value of -1.\n\nIn board 3, we come across two situations: either X wins or O wins. Since the goal is to maximize, we say that the board has a value of 1 (max of both the possibilities).\n\nNote: We need to explore several states to make the right choice.
