Over the past month, I've been working on creating my own programming language, GooseLang. It has nothing to do with geese - just has all the things I love about Python, C, Java etc compiled into one! Here are the features I've implemented so far:

Note: I am not an expert, I'm just interested in learning more about language development! Before starting, here is some research I did on the topic (that led to some design decisions later on):
- [[notes/Compiled and Interpreted Languages]]: GooseLang is going to be an Interpreted language for an easier development time, written in C++ (also, interpreted)
- High-level pipeline: [[Lexer|Lexing]]-[[Parsing]]-[[Action Tree]]
