**What is AI?**
From the name, it seems that the aim of artificial intelligence is to create artificially "intelligent" machines. This is a rather loose definition as witnessed by [[notes/Braitenberg vehicles|Braitenberg vehicles]] experiment. So, a better way to define AI: the study of having computers complete tasks, at which people are better.
- Machine Learning is important, because "learning" is a strength of human intelligence and we want to replicate this with computers.

**AI and Society**
- The big question has always been **will AI destroy jobs**?
	- AI will replace the unpleasant or dangerous jobs, completing tasks with more efficiency and precision
	- Rise of AI accelerates *growth/consumption spiral*
		- Companies want to lower prices, laying off workers to cut costs
		- Lower prices is higher demand, so higher production (using more resources here)
		- In modern countries, where population doesn't grow, individual person must consume more (marketing helps with this!)
	- More people left unsatisfied (consuming goods they don't want, high unemployment etc)
	- There needs to be an "economy for the common good" where we go for sustainability, rather than profit
